bootk=kvm

#
# network, netmask and gateway settings for new VMs

# Reminder of other local settings need to be done on all your installations:
# (Best to finish settings before copy the directory to other local systems)
#
# 1. Set the "scriptdir" in vm-deploy to the scripts installation path
# 2. Add all IP# allocated for vm-deploy script to the AvailableIP file
# 3. Adjust resolv.conf for your VM
# 4. Create vmdisks group and give it rwx access to VM disk image 
#    directory path on all vm-containers
#    $ ls -ld /state/partition1/xen 
#    drwxr-x--- 4 root vmdisks 4096 Jan  7  2011 /state/partition1/xen
#    $ ls -ld /state/partition1/xen/disks
#    drwxrwx--- 2 root vmdisks 4096 Oct  5 00:05 /state/partition1/xen/disks
# 5. Add the following line in /etc/sudoers on all vm-containers
#    %vmdisks ALL=NOPASSWD:/opt/vm-scripts/vm-new, /opt/vc-scripts/vc-new, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-makeover, /opt/vc-scripts/fe-makeover, /opt/vc-scripts/cn-makeover, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-start, /opt/vc-scripts/vc-start, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-cleanup, /opt/vc-scripts/vc-cleanup, /opt/vm-scripts/vm-free, /opt/vc-scripts/vc-free, /opt/rocks/bin/rocks, /bin/sh
