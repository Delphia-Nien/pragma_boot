                     Cloudstack integration in pragma_boot

Mar 22 - 29, 2016 AIST.

Goal: 

write a new driver for pragma_boot to use a CloudStack
as an underlying virtual cluster provisioning platform.

Plan: 

Use CloudStack REST API to access to deploy and undeploy virtual 
machines and clusters at AIST. 


Mapping of pragma_boot functions to CloudStack API:

----------------------------------------------------------------
pragma_boot        cloudstack API                        status
----------------------------------------------------------------
Allocate       deployVirtualMachine with startvm=false    done
Deploy         startVirtualMachine                        in progress
Shutdown VM    stopVIrtualMachine                         done, updated June 19
Clean VM       destroyVirtualMachine                      in progress
List clusters  listVirtualMachine                         done, updated June 19
----------------------------------------------------------------

Basic funciotonality of pragma_boot  using CloudStack API is completed. 

The remaining issues are:

A. UCSD todo list

1. Finalize functions "in progress" using REST API
2. Finalize implementation of deploy, shutdown and clean functions of pragma_boot.
3. vc-out.xml file propagation using userdata field and corresponding changes 
   to dynip roll and vm-out parser (debug authentication error.)
4. Test upload of templates from local repository and google drive. 
5. Test dual NIC configuration on the frontend
6. Test deploying rocks-based virtual cluster (will test the networking)
7. Error checking for boundary conditions
8. Commenting code and making documentation
9 test email from git

B. AIST todo list

1. Access to CloudStack from one of pragma hosts. 
2. Review CloudStack driver once UCSD complestes the code
   and enable public IP access to the VM's launched via CloudStack 


June 9, 2016 UCSD: Jason, Shava, Nadya

Work in progress:

- Nadya dual network interfaces 
- Shava trying to pass network info through user data interface
- Modifying Tarm's code 
- Special mode of clonezilla
  Upload virtual cluster -> create iso images -> move to google drive
  But would need a clonezilla instance on AIST resources to convert between
  clonezilla iso to qcawt. A better option will be to download a specific
  image (template) form the drive. Assumes that we can put pointer to GD url to pull template
 
Planned work:

- Need more public real ip addresses to truly test
- Is it ok to snapshot the Biolinux VM now?
  How much of VM depends on IP of VM?
- VM with data service on it that is bootable by pragmaboot
 
- End of June
  work out propagation of new network config to user VM
  Change "list, shutdown, delete" clusters - simplify and improve
      completed Change "list, shutdown" 
  Jason - ask Gabriel about receipe for installing data service
 
- Mid July
  Update networking interfaces, how to ask for public networking, upload new templates/VM
  New templates in cloudstack GUI, Community, MyISOs, Shared?
 
- End of July
  Finish, integrate method to get new images, cleanup
 
- Mid Aug
  Integrate/test cloud scheduler, demo prep
  Need public access at this time, otherwise no demo
 
- As soon as possible
  Jason to ASK: CS 4.8 api call - stopvirtualmachine, only returns jobID,
  complete list of info is not there. Why? Access control of user compared to
  admin? Is some functionality missing in GUI based on ACL.
